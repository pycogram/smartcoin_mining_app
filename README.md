# SmartCoin - the mining application.

**Smartcoin** is my first full-stack application built with:
- React + TypeScript + Vite,
- Express, 
- MongoDB,
- NodeJs,
- Tailwindcss (CSS),
- Figma ( Designs )

### Features include: 
- Signup / login system 
- Email verificaction 
- Referral-based bonus system 
- Send & Receive $SC between user
- Lock/stake $SC mechanism 
- Community chat 
- User profile 
- Report User
- Settings
- And many more

### Hosting platform:
Application hosted is on **Render**.

### SC Architecture:
The architecture is organized into clearly defined components, folders, and subfolders to maintain clean separation of concerns and ensure stability in production.

### UI Prototype:
The frontend was first designed and prototyped by me on **Figma** and then developed using Javascript libraries and CSS framework.

### Smartcoin Design:
SC was first designed on figma before I started coding it. The below is the all-in-one screenshot:
